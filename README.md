# Selene

A lightweight, standalone implementation of Laravel's Blade template engine syntax.

This project aims to provide a parser and renderer for Blade template syntax without requiring the full Laravel framework.

## Why This Project?

While Laravel's Blade template engine is powerful and elegant, sometimes you need a standalone solution that doesn't require the entire Laravel framework. This project will fill that gap by providing:

- Blade syntax
- No Laravel dependencies
- Easy integration into any PHP project
- Easy to extend with custom directives
- Compatible with existing Blade templates
